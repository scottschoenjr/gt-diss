% From the manual: "Chapters are customarily divided into subsections with subheadings
% that have slightlydiffering font styles and are designated first, second, and third-
% level. The first-level subdivision should have greater attention value than the lower
% levels. Centered headings have more attention value than headings beginning at the
% left margin, and italic, underlining, or bold-face type has more attention value than
% plain text. Attention value is also enhanced by leaving some blank space above and
% below". The "customarily" languate differs from language elsewhere in the document
% indicates compulsion (e.g., "must", "Leave three blank lines", etc.). Therefore I 
% interpret the section formatting as suggested, and ignore the suggestion, as I think
% changing fonts, weights, and styles is distracting. The new line, coupled with the 
% section number (e.g., 2.1.4) clearly indicates its importance.
